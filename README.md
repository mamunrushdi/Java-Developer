# My Profile as Java Developer
I'm a permanent residence of Russian Federation (есть Вид На Жительство) and a graduate of Peter the Great Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University.

Last year, at 2017 after graduating from Saint Petersburg Polytechnic University I've started to learn Computer Science and Programming language in deep at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) to extend my programming knowldege and skills.

In Coursera I've completed 15 courses which mainly focused on Object Oriented Programming in Java, Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed programming in Java, Shell programming, and Linux. Those courses were conducted by Duke University, University of San Diego, Rice University and John Hopkins University.

Among these 15 courses, 14 courses were part of 3 specialization courses, which are:

3) Parallel, Concurrent, and Distributed Programming in Java
by [Rice University](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/pcdp)
where I've learnt basic of:	

	1. Concurrency:
		- Concurrency theory: progress guarantees, deadlock, livelock, starvation, linearizability
		- Use of threads and structured/unstructured locks in Java		
		- Atomic variables and isolation		
		- Optimistic concurrency and concurrent collections in Java (e.g., concurrent queues, concurrent hashmaps)
		- Actor model in Java		
	1. Parallel	
		- Theory of parallelism: computation graphs, work, span, ideal parallelism, parallel speedup, Amdahl's Law, 		      data races, and determinism	
		- Task parallelism using Java’s ForkJoin framework		
		- Functional parallelism using Java’s Future and Stream frameworks		
		- Loop-level parallelism with extensions for barriers and iteration grouping (chunking)		
		- Dataflow parallelism using the Phaser framework and data-driven tasks		
	1. Distributed
		- Distributed map-reduce programming in Java using the Hadoop and Spark frameworks		
		- Client-server programming using Java's Socket and Remote Method Invocation (RMI) interfaces		
		- Message-passing programming in Java using the Message Passing Interface (MPI)		
		- Approaches to combine distribution with multithreading, including processes and threads, distributed 		          actors, and reactive programming		
	1. Optimistic Concurrency Control

I've successfully complete another course in Coursera on Unix based operating, called "The Unix Workbench"  by [John Hopkins University](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unix)
where I've learnt:
 -  Shell Script
 -  Github
 -  Bash (Unix Shell)
 -  Cloud Computing

_For the third specialization, "Object Oriented Java Programming: Data Structures and Beyond", I've completed all the courses of this specialization but could not get specialization certificate as I've submitted my Capston project for this specialization at the least time. It occurred, because at the beginning my project was far more challenging to complete in due time. Later I've taken a project which was possible to complete in due time but I could not get enough peer review to get a grade. Thus I didn't get the certificate. I hope in the upcoming session, which is going to be started at end December, I will get enough peer review and will achieve the certificate._

_[Accomplishment Cetificate of all the Courses](https://github.com/mmncoder/Coursera-Certificates)_
#### During learning peoriod of these Courses I've developed the follwoing projects:
 1. Analyzing DAN to detect a gene
 1. Analyzing data and answering question about this data
 1. Encrypting and Decrypting text
 1. Generating Random Story
 1. Building Move recommendation System
 
 	This was the Capston project of Java programming and software engineering fundamentals by Duke University.
In this system, at the beginning,  the user will be prompt to rate 10 -  15 movies to rate, and my program will use these rating to find similar raters and analyzing those similar rates make a list of recommendation movie list. 
*Please see details of this project in [GitHub](https://github.com/mmncoder/Movie-Recommendation-System)


 1. Visualize live Earthquake data in a Map
 
 	This program would read live data of earthquake from United States Geological Survey(USHS) and visualize those earthquake int a map.
In this project with Java basic libraries, I've also used third parties libraries, like:

	1. [Unfoldingmaps library](http://unfoldingmaps.org/)
	1. [Processing library](https://processing.org/)

	I‘ve used __JSON data__ in this project.

	Please see details of this project in [GitHub](https://github.com/mmncoder/Earthquake-Data-Visualization)
                
 1. Text editor to generate text using Markove model (small machine learning project), check word spell, auto suggestion for misspelled word and  auto-completion as soon as user start to type a word
 
 	In this project I’ve used different data structures like: List, Map, learn Markove model, read Flesch Score to determine a text’s difficulties to comprehend, distance between two words.
 	Please see details of this project in [GitHub](https://github.com/mmncoder/Text-Editor)
